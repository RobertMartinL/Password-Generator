Welcome to the random password generator.

The code within the javascript file is linked with an html file as well as a css file, creating a styled online application.
The purpose of this application is to create a random password for a user that is influenced by user selection.
The user initiates the password generator application with a button.
Once the button is pressed, the user is prompted to answer questions that will influence their generated password.

User prompted questions-

-Include UPPERCASE LETTERS?
-Include LOWERCASE LETTERS?
-Include NUMBERS?
-Include SYMBOLS?
-How long should the password be? (between 8 and 128 characters)

Once the user has answered the prompts, the javascript file uses functions to sort wanted and unwanted character types as well as 
limit the password to the specified length.

Once the code is finished running, the javascript file places the final product into a viewing tab.
